 This project contains minature games that help users to learn about the operation of the brain through a virtual experience. This project expands the realm of human computer interaction by incorportaing biometrics into the generation of virtual experiences.

 This project uses a virtual environment to immerse the user in the experience of the brain.
 This project uses a game space to build an education experience on the structure of the human brain.
Educational games rely on user control and clear learning outcomes and objectives. 
 This project uses biometrics to immerse the user in a virtual space of which they do not have full controll, but yet remain the author.

 This project builds a virtual experience that translate the structure of the human brain into a three-dimensional game.
Human computer interaction in video games and virtual reality is centered on the controlled and intentional manipulation of the virtual space.
